For two players:
Roll the dice to re-roll the values, bank score to switch players, and store selected dice to score the current selected dice.

Current glitches and things not implemented:

- Checking for Farkle
- Adding back the ability to click a die after your round is over
  - At the current moment, the game only allows each die to be clicked once throughout the whole game. Moving forward, I would implement a way to re-add the onclick ability after the player's turn is over.
